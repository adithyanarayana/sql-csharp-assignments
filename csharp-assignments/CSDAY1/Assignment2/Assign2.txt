ASSIGNMENT 2
Test your Knowledge
1. When to use String vs. StringBuilder in C# ?
Strings are immutable and stringBuilder objects are mutable 
We can use string for private, secure, less modifications required data 
And we can use StringBuilder for complex string operations and modifying data with loops  
2. What is the base class for all arrays in C#?
The base class for all arrays is “System.Array”. It gives class with methods for creating, manipulating, searching and sorting arrays. All arrays derive from this class. All kinds single, multi-dimensional or jagged arrays 
3. How do you sort an array in C#?
Sort elements in arry we can use 
Array.Sort(array) method 
4. What property of an array object can be used to get the total number of elements in
an array?
We get total number of elements in arry using length method; array.Length;
5. Can you store multiple data types in System.Array?
It is not possible to store multiple data types in System.Array 
6. What’s the difference between the System.Array.CopyTo() and System.Array.Clone()?
Both are used to create copies of arrays 
CopyTo(), it copies elements of arry to another existing arry 
Clone(), it creates a new array which is a copy of the original array 
CopyTo() can copy elements to exact position of an array and clone() will give you new array which is copy of the original array.
